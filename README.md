## Overview

**Paisa Mitra** is a personal finance and ledger management app built with **Flutter**. It combines:

- a **daily spending tracker** for your own expenses, and
- a **Khatabook-style party ledger** for tracking who you will give / who you will get money from.

It's designed to streamline **personal finance management**, reduce manual calculation errors, and provide real-time insights using local SQLite storage — all **offline**, no internet required.

## Features

- 📊 **Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly Views**

  Track your spending across multiple time ranges with tabbed navigation.

- 💰 **Category-Based Transactions**

  Add expenses with title, amount, date, and category for better organization.

- 🏷️ **Custom Categories**

  Add your own categories from the Categories screen. Categories are stored in SQLite and remain available after restarting the app. Default categories cannot be deleted.

- 👥 **Khatabook-Style Party Ledger**

  Create parties (contacts) and track "gave" or "got" transactions per party.

- 📈 **Automatic Balance Calculation**

  See **You will give** and **You will get** totals automatically calculated.

- 🎨 **Modern UI Design**

  Clean Material Design with custom fonts (`OpenSans`, `Quicksand`) and color-coded balances.

- 📊 **Visual Analytics**

  Charts and graphs using `fl_chart` for spending patterns and trends.

- 💾 **Offline Storage**

  All data stored locally using SQLite — no backend or internet connection needed.

  Provider state management ensures UI updates instantly when data changes.
